The project was done in the Nanodegree: AI programming with python in Udacity.

Practicing this in python: Dictionaries, exceptions, scripts, conditionals, slicing

In this project, I used a created image classifier to identify dog breeds and compared them with the actual data, 
to determine the performance of some CNN Architectures / Models.
